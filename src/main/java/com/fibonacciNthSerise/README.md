## 📘 What is the Fibonacci Series?

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The series starts from:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Prompts the user to **enter a limit** (integer `n`).
2. Calculates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Prints the numbers on the console separated by spaces.
